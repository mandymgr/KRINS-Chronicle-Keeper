# Quarantine for Review

## Purpose
This directory contains files that were identified as potentially unnecessary but moved here for safe review before permanent deletion.

## Duplicate Configuration Files (Moved: 2025-09-09)

The following duplicate configuration files were moved here:

- `duplicate-config-files/editorconfig-2` (originally `.editorconfig 2`)
- `duplicate-config-files/Dockerfile-2` (originally `Dockerfile 2`) 
- `duplicate-config-files/Makefile-2` (originally `Makefile 2`)
- `duplicate-config-files/frontend-Dockerfile-2` (originally `frontend/Dockerfile 2`)

**Status**: âœ… Safe to delete after verification
**Verification steps**:
1. Confirm the main config files (`.editorconfig`, `Dockerfile`, `Makefile`, `frontend/Dockerfile`) work correctly
2. Run build and development processes to ensure no dependencies on the duplicate files
3. After 1-2 weeks of successful operation, the entire `quarantine-for-review/` directory can be deleted

## Recovery Instructions
If any of these files are needed, they can be restored with:
```bash
# Example to restore .editorconfig 2 if needed:
cp quarantine-for-review/duplicate-config-files/editorconfig-2 ".editorconfig 2"
```

## Cleanup
Once verified that these files are not needed (recommended after 1-2 weeks of normal operation):
```bash
rm -rf quarantine-for-review/
```
