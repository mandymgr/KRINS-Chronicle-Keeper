# Development Database Files Archive

## Purpose
This directory contains SQLite database files that were removed from git tracking as they should not be committed to version control.

## Files Moved (2025-09-09)

### SQLite Database Files Removed:
1. **`ai-systems-krin-personal-companion/krin-memory.db`**
   - Original: `./ai-systems/krin-personal-companion/database/krin-memory.db`
   - Size: 53KB
   - Contains: Development memory data for Krin Personal Companion

2. **`ai-systems-krin-personal-companion-KRIN-SYSTEM/krin-memory.db`**
   - Original: `./ai-systems/krin-personal-companion/KRIN-SYSTEM/database/krin-memory.db`
   - Size: 53KB
   - Contains: KRIN-SYSTEM development data

3. **`AI_INTEGRATION-krin-companion/krin-memory.db`**
   - Original: `./AI_INTEGRATION/krin-companion/database/krin-memory.db`
   - Size: 45KB
   - Contains: AI Integration memory data

4. **`AI_INTEGRATION-krin-companion-KRIN-SYSTEM/krin-memory.db`**
   - Original: `./AI_INTEGRATION/krin-companion/KRIN-SYSTEM/database/krin-memory.db`
   - Size: 53KB
   - Contains: Integrated KRIN-SYSTEM data

**Total Database Files Removed**: 4 files (~200KB total)

## Why These Were Removed

### Problems with Database Files in Git:
- **Development Data**: Contains local development data that shouldn't be shared
- **Binary Files**: SQLite databases are binary files that don't diff well
- **Conflict Prone**: Multiple developers would have merge conflicts
- **Repository Bloat**: Database files add unnecessary size to repository
- **Security Risk**: May contain sensitive development data

### .gitignore Coverage:
The repository already has proper `.gitignore` rules to prevent database files:
```
# Database Files
**/*.sqlite
**/*.sqlite3
**/*.db
```

## Setting Up Fresh Databases

### For Krin Personal Companion:
```bash
# The applications will automatically create new database files when needed
# No manual setup required - databases will be initialized on first run

# Start Krin companion to initialize database:
bun run krin:companion
```

### For AI Integration:
```bash
# Unified AI launcher will create databases as needed:
bun AI_INTEGRATION/unified-ai-launcher.js context

# Or start Krin integration:
bun run krin:start
```

### Database Initialization:
- **Automatic**: Applications create SQLite databases on first run
- **Schema**: Database schemas are embedded in the application code
- **Data**: Applications start with empty databases and populate as needed
- **Location**: New databases will be created in the same directory paths

## Recovery Instructions

### If Original Database Data Is Needed:
```bash
# Restore specific database (example):
cp quarantine-for-review/development-databases/AI_INTEGRATION-krin-companion/krin-memory.db \
   AI_INTEGRATION/krin-companion/database/

# Remember to add back to .gitignore if restored:
echo "AI_INTEGRATION/krin-companion/database/krin-memory.db" >> .gitignore
```

### For Production Setup:
- Use proper database servers (PostgreSQL) for production
- SQLite databases are only for local development
- See `SYSTEM-STATUS.md` for production database setup

## Verification That System Still Works

### Test Commands:
```bash
# 1. Verify AI Integration still works:
bun AI_INTEGRATION/unified-ai-launcher.js status

# 2. Test Krin companion initialization:
bun run krin:start

# 3. Check if new databases are created:
find . -name "krin-memory.db" -newer quarantine-for-review/development-databases/
```

## Cleanup Timeline

These database files can be permanently deleted once confirmed that:
1. Applications create new databases successfully
2. All Krin companion functionality works
3. AI integration systems initialize properly
4. No critical data is lost

**Recommended cleanup**: After 2-4 weeks of normal operation without issues.
