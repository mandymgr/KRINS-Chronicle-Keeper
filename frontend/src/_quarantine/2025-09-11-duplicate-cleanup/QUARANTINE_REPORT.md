# Quarantine Report - Duplicate Cleanup 2025-09-11

## Moved to Quarantine
This folder contains duplicate/obsolete files moved on 2025-09-11

### Reason for Quarantine:
- Duplicate components causing confusion
- Obsolete dev_memory components  
- Alternative page versions no longer needed
- Bundle size optimization

### Files Moved:
1. **components_dev_memory/** - Entire dev memory folder (duplicate UI components)
2. **pages/Dashboard-elegant.tsx** - Alternative dashboard version
3. **pages/DeveloperHub.tsx** - Replaced by HubDashboard
4. **pages/ExamplePage.tsx** - Test page
5. **contexts/BlogAuthContext.tsx** - Unused blog auth context

### Active Components (KEPT):
- `/components/ui/*` - Main UI components
- `/design-system/components/*` - Design system (unique functionality)  
- `/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Main working dashboard
- `/pages/Intelligence.tsx` - Main intelligence page
- `/hub/pages/HubDashboard.tsx` - Hub version (unique functionality)
- `/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Main auth context

### Safe to Delete After:
- 2 weeks if no issues reported
- All references confirmed removed
- Build/tests pass without these files

### Restoration:
If needed, files can be moved back from this quarantine folder.

### Impact Assessment:
- Expected bundle size reduction: ~20-30%
- Reduced import confusion
- Cleaner project structure
- Easier maintenance
