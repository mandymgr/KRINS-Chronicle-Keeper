# ADR-0002: Frontend Framework Selection for Living Spec Dashboard

## Status

**ACCEPTED** - Decision made on 2024-01-08

## Context

We need to select a frontend framework for the Living Spec Dashboard that will serve as the primary interface for development teams to visualize project status, metrics, and documentation. The solution needs to support complex data visualization, real-time updates, and excellent developer experience.

### Requirements:
- TypeScript support with excellent type safety
- Server-side rendering for performance and SEO
- Real-time data updates capability
- Component-based architecture for maintainability
- Good ecosystem for data visualization libraries
- Internationalization (i18n) support for Norwegian and English
- Mobile-responsive design capabilities
- Integration with modern CSS frameworks

### Constraints:
- Team has strong React experience
- Need to ship MVP within 8 weeks
- Must support modern web standards and accessibility
- Integration with existing backend APIs
- Performance requirements: <2s initial page load

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Next.js 14 with App Router
**Pros:**
- Excellent TypeScript integration out of the box
- App Router provides modern, file-based routing
- Built-in optimization (images, fonts, bundles)
- Server-side rendering and static generation
- Strong ecosystem and community support
- Easy API route creation for backend integration
- Excellent developer experience with hot reloading
- Built-in internationalization support

**Cons:**
- Learning curve for App Router (newer paradigm)
- Can be overkill for simple applications
- Some configuration complexity for advanced use cases

### Option 2: Vite + React + React Router
**Pros:**
- Extremely fast development build times
- Flexible and unopinionated setup
- Smaller bundle sizes
- More control over build configuration
- Good TypeScript support
- Large ecosystem of plugins

**Cons:**
- More setup and configuration required
- No built-in SSR without additional tools
- Need to configure internationalization manually
- Less opinionated structure can lead to inconsistencies
- More complex deployment setup

### Option 3: SvelteKit
**Pros:**
- Excellent performance characteristics
- Smaller bundle sizes than React
- Built-in state management
- Great TypeScript support
- Server-side rendering capabilities
- Modern development experience

**Cons:**
- Smaller ecosystem compared to React
- Less team familiarity
- Fewer third-party component libraries
- Potential hiring challenges

### Option 4: Remix
**Pros:**
- Excellent data loading patterns
- Built-in form handling and validation
- Strong TypeScript support
- Server-side rendering focus
- Good performance characteristics
- Modern web standards approach

**Cons:**
- Smaller community and ecosystem
- Less team familiarity
- Fewer examples and tutorials
- Some uncertainty around long-term direction

## Decision

We will use **Next.js 14 with App Router** for our frontend implementation.

### Rationale:

1. **Team Expertise**: Strong existing React knowledge allows for faster development and easier onboarding of new team members.

2. **TypeScript Excellence**: Industry-leading TypeScript integration with excellent IDE support and type safety.

3. **Performance**: Built-in optimizations for images, fonts, and code splitting provide excellent performance out of the box.

4. **Full-Stack Capabilities**: API routes enable us to build backend functionality alongside frontend code when needed.

5. **Ecosystem**: Huge ecosystem of React components and libraries for data visualization (Chart.js, D3, etc.).

6. **Production Ready**: Mature framework with excellent deployment options (Vercel, Netlify, Docker).

7. **Future-Proof**: App Router represents the future direction of Next.js with better performance and developer experience.

## Implementation Details

### Architecture Decisions:
- Use App Router for all routing (not Pages Router)
- Implement TypeScript strict mode for maximum type safety
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling with custom Nordic design system
- Implement React Server Components where appropriate for performance
- Use client components for interactive features (charts, real-time updates)

### Key Libraries:
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent icon system
- **Charts**: Chart.js or D3.js for data visualization
- **Date Handling**: date-fns for internationalized date formatting
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form for complex forms
- **State Management**: React built-in state + Context for global state

### Project Structure:
```
app/
├── (marketing)/           # Marketing pages group
├── api/                  # API routes
├── components/           # Shared components  
├── lib/                  # Utilities and data fetching
└── globals.css          # Global styles
```

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Rapid development with familiar technology stack
- Excellent TypeScript support and developer experience
- Strong performance characteristics with built-in optimizations
- Large ecosystem of components and libraries
- Easy deployment and scaling options
- Good SEO and accessibility support out of the box

### Negative:
- App Router learning curve for team members
- Potential over-engineering for simple components
- Bundle size larger than some alternatives (though well-optimized)
- Dependency on Vercel ecosystem for optimal experience

### Neutral:
- Need to establish patterns for App Router usage
- Will need to evaluate server vs. client components carefully
- May need custom solutions for some advanced data visualization needs

## Performance Targets

- **Initial Page Load**: <2 seconds on 3G connection
- **Time to Interactive**: <3 seconds
- **Core Web Vitals**: All green scores
- **Bundle Size**: <500KB for initial bundle

## Migration Path

If we need to migrate away from Next.js in the future:
1. Components are standard React, easily portable
2. Business logic separated into custom hooks and utilities
3. API routes can be extracted to separate backend service
4. Styling with Tailwind is framework-agnostic

## Monitoring and Review

We will review this decision in **4 months (May 2024)** or after shipping the initial version to 10+ teams.

**Key metrics to monitor:**
- Developer productivity and satisfaction
- Application performance metrics
- Bundle size growth over time
- Build and deployment times

**Triggers for reconsideration:**
- Consistent performance issues not resolved by optimization
- Developer productivity significantly impacted by framework limitations
- Major ecosystem shifts affecting Next.js viability
- Team requests for different technology based on experience
