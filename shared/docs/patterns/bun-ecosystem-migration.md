# Bun Ecosystem Migration Pattern

## When to Use
Use this pattern when migrating Node.js/npm projects to Bun for improved performance and development experience. Apply when:
- Node.js applications need faster startup times
- Package installation is slow with npm/yarn
- TypeScript compilation needs optimization
- Development server reload is sluggish
- Bundle sizes need reduction

## Implementation
1. **Assessment**: Evaluate current npm/yarn dependencies for Bun compatibility
2. **Migration**: Replace package.json scripts with Bun equivalents
3. **Configuration**: Create bunfig.toml for Bun-specific settings
4. **Testing**: Verify all functionality works with Bun runtime
5. **Optimization**: Leverage Bun's built-in bundling and transpilation

## Quality Gates
- All dependencies are Bun-compatible
- Build and test scripts work correctly
- Performance improvements are measurable
- Development experience is enhanced
- Fallback options exist for unsupported features

## Anti-patterns
- Migrating without compatibility checking
- Removing npm/yarn support completely
- Not testing thoroughly after migration
- Ignoring Bun-specific optimizations
- Missing configuration for team consistency
