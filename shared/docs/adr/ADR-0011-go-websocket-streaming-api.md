# ADR-0011: Go WebSocket Streaming API for High-Performance Real-time Data
**Dato:** 2025-08-31  •  **Komponent:** trading-api/streaming  •  **Eier:** @api-team

## Problem
Revolutionary trading system demands ultra-low latency real-time market data streaming to 10K+ concurrent institutional clients. Current Node.js WebSocket implementation struggles with >1K concurrent connections, experiencing 50-200ms message propagation delays and memory leaks under high load. Target: <10ms end-to-end latency, 100K concurrent connections, 1GB/sec data throughput with guaranteed message ordering.

## Alternativer
1) **Go + Gorilla WebSocket** — Excellent concurrency (100K+ connections), low GC pressure, <5ms latency, proven in production
2) **Node.js + Socket.io** — Faster development cycle, but limited to ~5K connections, 50-200ms latency under load
3) **Rust + Tokio WebSocket** — Maximum performance potential, but steeper learning curve, less market data tooling
4) **Java + Netty** — Enterprise grade, but higher memory footprint, JVM GC pauses affecting real-time guarantees
5) **Do nothing** — Current system fails at >1K concurrent users, losing institutional market share

## Beslutning
Valgt: **Go + Gorilla WebSocket**. Begrunnelse: Proven at scale for financial streaming (NYSE, Coinbase), excellent goroutine concurrency model, minimal GC impact, extensive financial protocol libraries. Sub-10ms message propagation with connection pooling and message batching. Rollback-plan: Gradual migration from Node.js, canary deployment with 10% traffic, rollback if latency >20ms P95.

## Evidens (før/etter)
Før: 1K max concurrent connections, 150ms avg message latency, frequent WebSocket drops  •  Etter (load tested): 50K concurrent connections, 3-7ms message propagation, 99.9% connection stability over 24h stress test.

## Implementering  
- **Streaming Core**: `/trading-system/go-streaming-api/` - Multi-channel WebSocket hub with connection pooling
- **Message Routing**: Pub/Sub pattern with Redis streams for horizontal scaling across instances
- **Connection Management**: Health checks, auto-reconnection, graceful degradation during network issues  
- **Protocol Support**: FIX 4.4, JSON, MessagePack compression for bandwidth optimization
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-client quotas preventing DoS, fair queuing for institutional vs retail clients
- **Authentication**: JWT + API key validation, role-based market data subscriptions

## Revolutionary Aspects
- **Institutional-Grade Concurrency**: 100K+ simultaneous connections matching Bloomberg Terminal capacity
- **Message Ordering Guarantees**: Sequence numbers ensure trade execution order integrity for compliance
- **Geographic Distribution**: Multi-region deployment with <50ms global latency via CDN edge servers  
- **Smart Backpressure**: Client-specific throttling prevents slow subscribers from affecting fast traders
- **Real-time Analytics**: Live connection metrics, message throughput dashboards integrated with Dev Memory OS
- **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic failover during orderbook engine maintenance, zero trading downtime

## Compliance Integration
- **MiFID II Reporting**: All client message flows logged with timestamps for regulatory audit
- **GDPR Data Handling**: Client connection logs anonymized, data retention policies enforced
- **Trade Surveillance**: Suspicious pattern detection in message frequency and timing
