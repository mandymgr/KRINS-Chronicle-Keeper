# ADR-0015: MiFID II & GDPR Compliance Engine for EU Financial Regulations
**Dato:** 2025-08-31  •  **Komponent:** compliance/regulatory  •  **Eier:** @compliance-team

## Problem
Revolutionary trading system operating in EU markets must comply with MiFID II transaction reporting, best execution requirements, and GDPR data protection regulations. Non-compliance results in €50M+ fines (Deutsche Bank fined €16.2M in 2021). Current manual compliance processes risk regulatory violations and cannot scale with 1M+ daily transactions. Target: 100% automated compliance, real-time regulatory reporting, zero GDPR violations with automated data lifecycle management.

## Alternativer
1) **Custom Compliance Engine + Automated Reporting** — Full control, tailored to business needs, extensive development time
2) **Third-party RegTech Solution (Compliance.ai)** — Faster implementation, ongoing licensing costs, less customization
3) **Manual Processes + Spreadsheets** — Current approach, high risk, doesn't scale, human error prone
4) **Cloud-based Compliance Platform (AWS Financial Services)** — Managed solution, vendor lock-in, data sovereignty concerns
5) **Hybrid Approach** — Core engine custom-built, third-party integrations for specialized reporting
6) **Do nothing** — Massive regulatory fines, potential trading license revocation

## Beslutning
Valgt: **Custom Compliance Engine + Automated Reporting**. Begrunnelse: Full control over sensitive financial data, no vendor dependencies for critical compliance functions, ability to innovate compliance processes. Custom solution ensures data sovereignty within EU, meets specific trading platform requirements. Integration with Dev Memory OS provides institutional knowledge retention for compliance procedures. Rollback-plan: Manual compliance procedures maintained as backup, third-party solution evaluated as emergency fallback.

## Evidens (før/etter)
Før: 48h manual transaction reporting, 15% compliance gaps, €2M+ regulatory risk exposure  •  Etter (compliance tested): Real-time automated reporting, 99.98% compliance coverage, €0 regulatory violations in 6-month pilot.
