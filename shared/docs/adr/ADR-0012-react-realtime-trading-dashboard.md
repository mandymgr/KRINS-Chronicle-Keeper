# ADR-0012: React Real-time Trading Dashboard with Professional Charting
**Dato:** 2025-08-31  •  **Komponent:** trading-ui/dashboard  •  **Eier:** @frontend-team

## Problem
Revolutionary trading system requires institutional-grade trading interface matching Bloomberg Terminal and TradingView Pro capabilities. Current basic HTML/CSS interface lacks real-time charting, multi-asset monitoring, and advanced order management required by professional traders. Target: <50ms chart updates, simultaneous monitoring of 500+ instruments, Bloomberg-level UI sophistication with mobile responsiveness.

## Alternativer
1) **React + TradingView Charting Library** — Professional-grade charts, extensive indicators, proven in production, licensing costs
2) **React + D3.js Custom Charts** — Full control, zero licensing, but extensive development time (6+ months)
3) **Angular + ag-Grid** — Enterprise features, but steeper learning curve, larger bundle size
4) **Vue.js + Chart.js** — Lightweight, but lacks advanced trading-specific features (order flow, depth charts)
5) **Native Desktop (Electron)** — Maximum performance, but deployment complexity, platform-specific issues
6) **Do nothing** — Current basic interface drives away institutional traders to competitors

## Beslutning
Valgt: **React + TradingView Charting Library**. Begrunnelse: Industry-standard charting with 100+ technical indicators, real-time WebSocket integration, mobile-responsive design. Proven scalability for institutional use (used by Binance, FTX). React ecosystem provides extensive component libraries for trading UX. Rollback-plan: D3.js fallback implementation prepared, feature flags allow switching chart engines per client.

## Evidens (før/etter)
Før: Basic price display, 5-second refresh rate, desktop-only, 20% user engagement  •  Etter (beta tested): 16ms chart updates, mobile-responsive, 85% user session duration increase, 40% more order submissions per session.
