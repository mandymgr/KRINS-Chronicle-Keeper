## üéØ **OBJECTION HANDLING**

### ‚ùì **"We already have Confluence/Notion"**
**Response**: "Those are great for documentation, but KRINS is specifically designed for decision intelligence. We don't just store information - we analyze decision effectiveness, predict outcomes, and generate actionable insights. It's like comparing a filing cabinet to a business intelligence platform."

### ‚ùì **"Our engineers won't adopt another tool"**
**Response**: "We understand adoption challenges, which is why KRINS integrates seamlessly into existing workflows. Engineers interact through GitHub, Slack, and their IDE - no context switching required. Plus, our AI companions adapt to individual work styles, making the tool feel personalized rather than imposed."

### ‚ùì **"This seems expensive for a knowledge management tool"**
**Response**: "The ROI calculation shows this pays for itself in the first month. Consider: if we prevent just one architectural mistake costing $500K, we've covered 15+ years of licensing fees. Plus, this isn't knowledge management - it's organizational intelligence that gets smarter over time."

**Response**: "Absolutely. That's why we offer a 30-day pilot with a limited team. You'll see measurable results in decision speed and quality within weeks. Plus, our architecture is designed for enterprise scale - we can demonstrate with organizations similar to yours."
