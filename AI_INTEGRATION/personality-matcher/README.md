  }
}
```

## 📊 How The Matching Algorithm Works

### **1. Trait Scoring**
Each answer contributes points to different personality traits:
```javascript
traits: { 
  empathy: 3,      // Strong empathetic response
  directness: 1,   // Slightly direct
  creativity: 2    // Moderately creative
}
```

### **2. Profile Matching**  
Your total scores are compared against each personality's ideal profile:
```javascript
// Calculate similarity score
const similarity = Math.max(0, 3 - Math.abs(userScore - personalityScore));
matchScore += similarity * personalityScore;
```

### **3. Weighted Results**
Matches are ranked by compatibility percentage, showing your top 3 options with detailed explanations.
