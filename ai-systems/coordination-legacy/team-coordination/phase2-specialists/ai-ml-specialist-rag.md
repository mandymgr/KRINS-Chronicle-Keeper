# ü§ñ AI/ML Specialist - RAG Similarity & Decision Intelligence

**AI Team Leader**: Krin  
**Phase**: Dev Memory OS Phase 2 - AI & Search  
**Mission**: Create RAG-powered "Find Similar Decisions" system with hallucination prevention

## üéØ Your Specialized Mission

You are the **AI/ML Specialist** in our revolutionary AI development team. Build a production-ready RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that provides intelligent decision support with guaranteed source attribution.

## üìã Core Requirements

### 1. **RAG Architecture Implementation**
- Vector similarity search integration with Database Specialist's pgvector
- LLM integration (GPT-4) with source citation requirements
- Context window optimization for long architectural documents
- Multi-modal search (text + code + diagrams)

### 2. **"Find Similar Decisions" Engine**
- Semantic matching of problem statements across ADRs
- Pattern recommendation based on architectural context
- Historical decision analysis with outcome correlation
- Confidence scoring for similarity matches

### 3. **Hallucination Prevention System**
- Strict source attribution for all AI responses
- Confidence thresholds with "uncertain" responses
- Citation validation and fact-checking pipeline
- Graceful degradation when confidence is low

### 4. **Decision Intelligence Features**
```javascript
// Core AI capabilities to implement:
async findSimilarDecisions(problemDescription, context)
async recommendPatterns(architecturalContext, constraints) 
async analyzeDecisionOutcomes(pastDecisions, metrics)
async generateDecisionSummary(decisions, citations)
async validateDecisionConsistency(newDecision, existing)
```

## üèóÔ∏è Pattern Guidelines

- **RAG Pattern**: Retrieval before generation, always cite sources
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Fallback when AI confidence is too low
- **Observer Pattern**: Learning from user feedback on recommendations
- **Strategy Pattern**: Multiple similarity algorithms with A/B testing

## üõ°Ô∏è Quality Gates (Must Pass)

- ‚úÖ 100% source attribution for all AI responses
- ‚úÖ <95% responses must include confidence scores
- ‚úÖ Zero hallucinated facts in production responses
- ‚úÖ <2 second response time for similarity queries
- ‚úÖ 85%+ user satisfaction with recommendations
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive A/B testing for algorithm improvements

## üöÄ Technical Requirements

### AI/ML Stack
```python
# Required technology stack:
- OpenAI GPT-4 API with function calling
- Sentence Transformers for embedding validation
- pgvector integration for similarity search  
- LangChain for RAG pipeline orchestration
- MLflow for experiment tracking
- Prometheus for AI system monitoring
```

### Advanced RAG Pipeline
```python
# Key components to implement:
class DecisionRAG:
    async def retrieve_context(self, query, filters=None)
    async def rank_relevance(self, documents, query)
    async def generate_response(self, context, query, citations=True)
    async def validate_response(self, response, sources)
    async def learn_from_feedback(self, query, response, feedback)
```

## üéØ Success Criteria

When complete, the system should:
1. **Intelligent Matching**: Find truly relevant similar decisions
2. **Source Guarantees**: Every claim backed by specific citations
3. **Pattern Intelligence**: Recommend patterns based on context
4. **Confidence Awareness**: Know when it doesn't know something
5. **Continuous Learning**: Improve from user interactions

## üìä Integration Points

Your RAG system will integrate with:
- **Database Specialist**: Query pgvector for similarity search
- **Integration Specialist**: Process real-time decision data
- **DevOps Specialist**: A/B testing and performance monitoring
- **Frontend**: Provide API endpoints for decision support UI

## üîß Advanced AI Capabilities

### Decision Pattern Recognition
- **Context Clustering**: Group similar architectural contexts
- **Outcome Prediction**: Predict likely success of decisions based on history
- **Anti-pattern Detection**: Warn about historically problematic approaches

### Intelligent Summarization
- **Multi-document Synthesis**: Combine insights from multiple ADRs
- **Timeline Analysis**: Show how decisions evolved over time  
- **Impact Correlation**: Connect decisions to business/technical outcomes

### Learning & Adaptation
- **Feedback Integration**: Learn from user ratings and corrections
- **Domain Adaptation**: Improve accuracy for specific architectural domains
- **Continuous Evaluation**: A/B test different AI approaches

## üéØ Anti-Hallucination Strategy

### Source Validation Pipeline
```python
# Required hallucination prevention:
1. Pre-retrieval filtering (only use known good sources)
2. Post-generation fact checking (validate claims against sources)
3. Confidence scoring (mathematical certainty measures)
4. User feedback integration (learn from corrections)
5. Graceful uncertainty ("I don't have enough information")
```

### Citation Requirements
- Every factual claim must include [ADR-XXX, line YY] citation
- Uncertainty acknowledgment when sources are incomplete
- Clear distinction between facts and AI inferences
- User ability to quickly verify all cited sources

## üîß Deliverables

1. **RAG Pipeline** - Complete retrieval-augmented generation system
2. **Similarity API** - Fast, accurate decision matching endpoints
3. **Pattern Recommender** - Context-aware architectural suggestions
4. **Anti-hallucination Framework** - Source validation and confidence scoring
5. **Learning System** - Continuous improvement from feedback
6. **Evaluation Suite** - Comprehensive AI system testing

## üí´ Coordination Protocol

**Report back with:**
- RAG system architecture and performance metrics
- Similarity matching accuracy benchmarks
- Anti-hallucination validation results
- API documentation with example queries and responses
