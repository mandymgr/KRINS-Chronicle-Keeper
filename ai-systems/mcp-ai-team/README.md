- **ADR Generation**: Architecture Decision Records created automatically
- **Learning Loop**: Each project improves future AI team performance

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
cd mcp-ai-team
npm install
```

### Start the MCP Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will start on:
- **HTTP API**: http://localhost:3004  
- **WebSocket**: ws://localhost:3005/ws
- **Dashboard Integration**: http://localhost:3000

### Spawn Your First AI Team

```bash
# Via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3004/specialists/spawn \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"role": "backend"}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:3004/specialists/spawn \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"role": "frontend"}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:3004/specialists/spawn \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"role": "testing"}'
```

### Start Autonomous Project Development

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3004/projects/coordinate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "description": "Build a todo application with user authentication", 
    "config": {
      "context": "web-app",
      "techStack": ["react-typescript", "node-express"],
      "requirements": ["authentication", "responsive-design"]
    }
  }'
```

## üìä API Endpoints

## üéØ Example Usage

### 1. Autonomous Web App Development

```javascript
// Start autonomous development
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3004/projects/coordinate', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    description: 'E-commerce platform with AI recommendations',
    config: {
      context: 'web-app',
      techStack: ['react-typescript', 'node-express', 'postgresql'],
      requirements: ['authentication', 'payment-processing', 'ai-recommendations']
    }
  })
});

// Result: Complete production-ready e-commerce platform in 4-6 hours
// - Backend API with payment integration
// - React frontend with AI-powered product recommendations  
// - Comprehensive test suite with >90% coverage
// - Full documentation and deployment configuration
```

### 2. Real-time Specialist Coordination

```javascript
// Connect to real-time coordination feed
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:3005/ws');

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  
  if (data.type === 'activity') {
    console.log(`${data.activity.emoji} ${data.activity.specialistName}: ${data.activity.message}`);
  }
  
  if (data.type === 'project_update') {
    console.log(`Project: ${data.project.description} - ${data.project.status}`);
  }
};

// See real AI specialists coordinating in real-time:
// ‚öôÔ∏è Backend Specialist: Designing REST API architecture
// üé® Frontend Specialist: Creating responsive React components  
// üß™ Testing Specialist: Running comprehensive test suite
// üöÄ DevOps Specialist: Setting up CI/CD pipeline
