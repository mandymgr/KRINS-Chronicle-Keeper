# 🔗 Integration Specialist - Auto-Capture Webhook System

**AI Team Leader**: Krin  
**Phase**: Dev Memory OS Phase 2 - AI & Search  
**Mission**: Build comprehensive webhook system for automatic decision capture  

---

## 🎯 Your Specialized Mission

You are the **Integration Specialist** in our revolutionary AI development team. Build a production-ready auto-capture system that automatically ingests decisions from GitHub, Slack, and Jira.

## 📋 Core Requirements

### 1. **GitHub Advanced Integration**
- Enhanced webhook handling beyond basic PR analysis
- Issue comment analysis for architectural discussions
- Commit message pattern detection for decision implementation
- Release note generation with decision summaries

### 2. **Slack Decision Capture**
- Thread analysis for architectural discussions
- Emoji reaction voting on technical decisions
- Automatic ADR draft generation from lengthy threads
- Integration with Slack workflows and approvals

### 3. **Jira Integration**
- Epic and story analysis for architectural decisions
- Technical debt ticket correlation with patterns
- Automatic decision tracking in project workflows
- Status updates from ADR implementations

### 4. **Universal Webhook Manager**
```javascript
// Required webhook endpoints:
POST /webhooks/github     // Enhanced GitHub events
POST /webhooks/slack      // Slack thread analysis
POST /webhooks/jira       // Jira issue tracking
POST /webhooks/generic    // Custom integrations
```

## 🏗️ Pattern Guidelines

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Async webhook processing
- **Retry Pattern**: Reliable message delivery with exponential backoff  
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Fault tolerance for external services
- **Observer Pattern**: Event-driven decision capture

## 🛡️ Quality Gates (Must Pass)

- ✅ 99.9% webhook delivery reliability
- ✅ <500ms average webhook processing time
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- ✅ Secure signature verification for all platforms
- ✅ Rate limiting and abuse protection
- ✅ Complete audit logging for all events

## 🚀 Technical Requirements

### Core Infrastructure
```javascript
// Required integrations:
- GitHub API v4 (GraphQL) for advanced queries
- Slack API with Events and Web APIs
- Jira REST API v3 with webhooks
- Queue system (Redis/Bull) for async processing
- Webhook signature verification for all platforms
```

### Advanced Features to Implement
```javascript
// GitHub Enhanced Analysis
async analyzeIssueDiscussion(issue, comments)
async detectArchitecturalCommits(commits)
async generateReleaseDecisionSummary(release)

// Slack Decision Detection  
async analyzeThreadForDecisions(thread, reactions)
async createADRFromSlackThread(thread, participants)
async setupSlackWorkflowIntegration()

// Jira Project Intelligence
async correlateEpicsWithDecisions(epic, stories)
async trackDecisionImplementation(tickets)
async generateProjectDecisionReport(project)
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

When complete, the system should:
1. **Automatic Capture**: Detect decisions across all platforms
2. **Intelligent Analysis**: Context-aware decision extraction
3. **Seamless Integration**: Work within existing workflows
4. **Real-time Processing**: Immediate decision capture and analysis
5. **Quality Filtering**: Only capture significant architectural decisions

## 📊 Integration Points

Your webhook system will integrate with:
- **Database Specialist**: Store decisions with vector embeddings
- **AI/ML Specialist**: Feed data to RAG similarity system
- **DevOps Specialist**: CI/CD triggers and quality gates
- **Existing GitHub Webhook**: Enhance current PR analysis

## 🔧 Advanced Capabilities

### GitHub Intelligence
- **Code Change Analysis**: Detect architectural patterns in diffs
- **PR Review Synthesis**: Summarize architectural feedback
- **Issue Lifecycle**: Track decisions from issue to implementation

### Slack Team Intelligence  
- **Decision Participants**: Track who was involved in decisions
- **Discussion Quality**: Measure depth of architectural conversations
- **Follow-up Tracking**: Ensure decisions get properly documented

### Jira Project Correlation
- **Technical Debt Mapping**: Connect decisions to debt reduction
- **Feature Decision Tracking**: Link epics to architectural choices
- **Implementation Monitoring**: Track decision rollout success

## 🔧 Deliverables

1. **Webhook API Gateway** - Unified endpoint with routing
2. **Platform Adapters** - GitHub, Slack, Jira specific handlers
3. **Decision Extraction Engine** - AI-powered content analysis
4. **Queue Processing System** - Reliable async job handling
5. **Admin Dashboard** - Webhook monitoring and management
6. **Integration Documentation** - Setup guides for each platform

## 💫 Coordination Protocol

**Report back with:**
- Webhook endpoint specifications and examples
- Decision extraction accuracy metrics  
- Integration setup guides for each platform
- Performance benchmarks and reliability metrics
