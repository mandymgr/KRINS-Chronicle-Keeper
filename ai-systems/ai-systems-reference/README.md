**Legacy AI Coordination System - Preserved for Reference and Wisdom**

*Built by Krin & Mandy - Historical prototype of AI team collaboration*

> **Note:** This is the original prototype that evolved into the current AI-SYSTEMS ecosystem. Keep as reference for patterns, documentation, and historical context.

## 🎯 System Overview

The AI Pattern Bridge System enables coordination of multiple AI agents (Claude, GPT, Gemini) working together on complex software projects. It converts institutional knowledge patterns into specialized AI instructions for parallel development.

## 🚀 Core Capabilities

### 1. Pattern-Driven AI Coordination
- Converts patterns into specialized AI instructions
- Assigns roles (frontend, backend, testing, devops)
- Ensures consistent quality across AI agents

### 2. Auto-Capture System
- GitHub webhook integration
- Automatic ADR generation from PRs
- Pattern learning from development activities

### 3. Multi-Terminal Coordination
- Specialized task generation for parallel development
- Quality gates and success criteria
- Cross-AI communication protocols

## 🛠 Quick Start

### Start the Auto-Capture System:
```bash
cd ai-coordination/core
PORT=3002 AUTO_CREATE_ADR=true bun github-webhook-handler.js
```

### Generate AI Team Instructions:
```javascript
const { AIPatternBridge } = require('./core/ai-pattern-bridge');
const bridge = new AIPatternBridge();

const instructions = await bridge.generateAIInstructions(
  'Build a microservices architecture',
  'backend-system'
);
```

### Multi-Terminal Coordination:
1. Use tasks from `team-coordination/` folder
2. Copy-paste to separate Claude Code terminals  
3. Each AI works on specialized component
4. Coordinate results through pattern consistency

## 📊 Success Metrics

- **ADR Generation**: Automatic documentation from development activities
- **Pattern Consistency**: Reusable solutions across projects
- **AI Coordination**: Multiple specialists working in parallel
- **Quality Gates**: Automated enforcement of best practices

## 🎯 Revolutionary Impact

This system transforms how AI development works:
- From **single AI** → **coordinated AI teams**
- From **ad-hoc decisions** → **pattern-driven architecture**
- From **manual documentation** → **auto-captured knowledge**
- From **isolated work** → **collaborative development**
