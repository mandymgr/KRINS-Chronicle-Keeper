# ADR-0001: Vector Database Selection for AI-Powered Project Insights

## Status

**ACCEPTED** - Decision made on 2024-01-10

## Context

Our Living Spec Dashboard needs to implement AI-powered insights and intelligent search capabilities across project documentation, tasks, risks, and historical data. This requires a vector database solution to store and query embeddings for semantic search and similarity matching.

### Requirements:
- Store high-dimensional vectors (1536 dimensions for OpenAI embeddings)
- Fast similarity search (cosine similarity, euclidean distance)
- Integration with existing PostgreSQL infrastructure
- Support for metadata filtering alongside vector queries
- Horizontal scaling capabilities for multiple teams/projects
- Developer-friendly with good TypeScript/Node.js support

### Constraints:
- Must integrate well with our existing Next.js/PostgreSQL stack
- Limited budget for additional infrastructure
- Need for rapid prototyping and development velocity
- Team expertise primarily in JavaScript/TypeScript

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Supabase Vector (pgvector extension)
**Pros:**
- Built on PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- Seamless integration with existing relational data
- Familiar SQL interface for complex queries
- Managed service with good developer experience
- Cost-effective for our scale
- Built-in authentication and real-time subscriptions

**Cons:**
- Newer product with smaller community
- Limited advanced vector indexing options
- Performance may not match specialized vector databases at scale

### Option 2: Native pgvector with self-managed PostgreSQL
**Pros:**
- Full control over configuration and optimization
- Proven PostgreSQL stability and ecosystem
- Cost-effective for long-term operation
- Can leverage existing PostgreSQL expertise
- Excellent integration with existing data

**Cons:**
- Requires significant DevOps overhead for management
- Need to handle scaling, backups, monitoring ourselves
- More complex setup and maintenance
- Limited specialized vector indexing compared to dedicated solutions

### Option 3: Pinecone
**Pros:**
- Purpose-built for vector search with excellent performance
- Managed service with minimal operational overhead  
- Advanced indexing algorithms (hierarchical navigable small world graphs)
- Good documentation and developer tools
- Proven at scale with many successful implementations

**Cons:**
- Additional cost and service dependency
- Data lives outside our primary database
- Need to maintain consistency between PostgreSQL and Pinecone
- Less familiar to team, additional learning curve
- Vendor lock-in concerns

### Option 4: Weaviate
**Pros:**
- Open-source with managed cloud option
- Built-in support for various ML models
- GraphQL API familiar to frontend developers
- Good hybrid search capabilities (vector + keyword)
- Strong schema and data modeling features

**Cons:**
- Additional infrastructure complexity
- Learning curve for team
- Need to manage data synchronization
- Cost considerations for managed service

## Decision

We will use **Supabase Vector (pgvector extension)** for our initial implementation.

### Rationale:

1. **Integration Simplicity**: Seamlessly integrates with our existing PostgreSQL-based architecture, allowing us to store vectors alongside relational data in a single system.

2. **Development Velocity**: Familiar SQL interface and excellent TypeScript support enable rapid development and iteration.

3. **Cost Effectiveness**: Fits within our budget constraints while providing managed infrastructure benefits.

4. **Data Consistency**: Eliminates the complexity of maintaining consistency between multiple database systems.

5. **Migration Path**: If we outgrow Supabase Vector's capabilities, we can migrate to pgvector on self-managed PostgreSQL or transition to a specialized solution like Pinecone.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: MVP Implementation (2-4 weeks)
- Set up Supabase project with pgvector extension enabled
- Create vector tables for documents, tasks, and insights
- Implement basic similarity search for project documentation
- Build embedding generation pipeline using OpenAI APIs

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (4-6 weeks)  
- Implement hybrid search (vector + metadata filtering)
- Add semantic search across all project artifacts
- Build AI-powered project insights and recommendations
- Performance optimization and indexing strategies

### Phase 3: Scale and Monitor (ongoing)
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Evaluate scaling needs and potential migration paths
- User feedback integration and feature enhancement

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Faster time to market with familiar technology stack
- Reduced operational complexity and infrastructure management
- Cost-effective solution for our current scale
- Easy integration with existing authentication and data flows
- Good TypeScript/JavaScript ecosystem support

### Negative:
- May hit performance limitations as we scale to hundreds of teams
- Less specialized vector indexing compared to purpose-built solutions  
- Dependency on Supabase service availability and roadmap
- Potential need for migration if requirements exceed capabilities

### Neutral:
- Team needs to learn pgvector-specific query patterns
- Will need monitoring to understand performance characteristics
- May need to implement custom caching strategies for frequently accessed vectors

## Monitoring and Review

We will review this decision in **6 months (July 2024)** or when we reach **50 active teams** using the platform, whichever comes first.

**Key metrics to monitor:**
- Query response times for vector similarity searches
- Database storage growth and costs
- User satisfaction with AI-powered features
- Development team productivity with current toolchain

**Triggers for reconsideration:**
- Vector query times consistently >500ms
- Storage costs exceeding $200/month
- Supabase Vector feature gaps blocking key requirements
- Team requests for more advanced vector capabilities
