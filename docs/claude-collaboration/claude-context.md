# Parse ADRs for actionable intelligence
bun AI_INTEGRATION/adr-parser.ts parse ADR-0001
bun AI_INTEGRATION/adr-parser.ts search --templates --actionable
```

### üìã Decision Management Excellence
```bash
# Advanced decision analytics
bun DECISION_MANAGEMENT/decision-tracker.ts analytics
bun DECISION_MANAGEMENT/decision-tracker.ts search "database"
bun DECISION_MANAGEMENT/decision-tracker.ts report > decision-report.md
```

### üìö Knowledge Organization
```bash
# Pattern creation with ADR integration
node tools/create-pattern.js "User Authentication" typescript "OAuth2 implementation pattern"
node tools/create-pattern.js --list
```

### üéØ MCP Command Integration
```bash
# Using .mcp.json configured intelligent commands
claude "konsistent-kode ny-pattern 'Payment Service' 'backend'"
claude "dybde-analyse prosjektstruktur"  
claude "dokumentasjon oppdater-docs"
claude "arkitektur-optimalisering konsistenssjekk"
```

## How to Continue This Collaboration

### 1. **Read the Current State Documentation**
```bash
# Essential reading to understand current capabilities
cat KRINS-WORKFLOW.md
# Focus on "Technical Architecture Achievements" section

cat CLAUDE.md
# Review all KRINS-specific commands and workflows
```

### 2. **Understand the AI Integration Layer**
```bash
# Explore the sophisticated AI integration
cat AI_INTEGRATION/context-provider.ts | head -100
cat AI_INTEGRATION/adr-parser.ts | head -100
```

### 3. **Test Current Capabilities**
```bash
# Test decision management
bun DECISION_MANAGEMENT/decision-tracker.ts list

# Test AI context generation
bun AI_INTEGRATION/context-provider.ts generate test-ai code-generation "Sample request"
```

## Integration Opportunities

## Collaboration Principles

### üéØ **ALWAYS BEST SOLUTION PRINCIPLE**
We work towards the best, most complete solution - never halfway!
- ‚úÖ Complete every task fully before moving to the next
- ‚úÖ Solve problems when they arise - no temporary workarounds
- ‚úÖ Perfect implementation - not "works sort of"
- ‚úÖ System should be better than all others - highest quality

### üß† **Semantic Intelligence Focus**
Every feature should enhance organizational understanding:
- Context-aware recommendations
- Relationship mapping between decisions
- Pattern recognition and optimization
- Predictive decision support

### ü§ù **Multi-AI Coordination**
Design for multiple AI specialists working together:
