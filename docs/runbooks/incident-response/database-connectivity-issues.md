# Database Connectivity Issues

## Description
Response procedure for database connection failures, timeouts, and pool exhaustion incidents.

## Prerequisites
- Access to database monitoring dashboard
- Database admin credentials
- Application server access
- Knowledge of connection pool configuration

## Steps

1. **Initial Assessment**
   - Check database monitoring dashboard for connection metrics
   - Verify database server status and resource utilization
   - Review recent application logs for connection errors
   - Check connection pool metrics (active, idle, waiting)

2. **Immediate Mitigation**
   - Scale up application instances if connection pool exhausted
   - Restart application servers with connection issues (rolling restart)
   - Check for long-running queries blocking connections
   - Increase connection pool size temporarily if needed

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Review recent database schema changes or migrations
   - Check for queries with missing indexes causing locks
   - Analyze connection pool configuration vs. actual load
   - Verify network connectivity between app servers and database

4. **Resolution**
   - Kill problematic long-running queries if identified
   - Apply database performance optimizations (indexes, query rewrites)
   - Adjust connection pool configuration based on analysis
   - Update monitoring alerts to catch similar issues earlier

5. **Post-Incident**
   - Document findings and resolution steps
   - Update runbooks if new patterns discovered
   - Review and improve monitoring and alerting
   - Schedule follow-up to ensure stability

## Recovery Time Objectives
- **Detection:** < 2 minutes (automated alerts)
- **Initial Response:** < 5 minutes
- **Service Restoration:** < 15 minutes
- **Full Resolution:** < 30 minutes

## Escalation
- Escalate to Database Team if database-level issues identified
- Escalate to Platform Team if infrastructure problems
- Notify stakeholders if RTO exceeded
